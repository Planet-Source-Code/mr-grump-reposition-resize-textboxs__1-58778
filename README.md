## Reposition/Resize Textboxs


</div>

### Description

I needed a method to resize or reposition a row of textboxes when form size changes. I knew it was possible but was unable to determine the math equations to make it work. I couldn't find an example anywhere so went to rent-a-coder out of desperation. A coder who's name I've since lost sent me this example free of charge. It's pretty well documented and I hope you find it useful.
